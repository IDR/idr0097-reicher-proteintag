Study Description	The levels and subcellular localizations of proteins regulate critical aspects of many cellular processes and can become targets of therapeutic intervention. However, high-throughput methods for unbiased discovery of proteins that change localization either by shuttling between compartments, by binding larger complexes or by localizing to distinct membraneless organelles are not available. Here we describe a scalable strategy to characterize effects on protein localizations and levels in response to different perturbations. We use CRISPR-Cas9 based intron tagging to generate cell pools expressing hundreds of GFP-fusion proteins from their endogenous promoters and monitor localization changes by time-lapse microscopy followed by clone identification using in situ sequencing. We show that this strategy can characterize cellular responses to drug treatment and thus identify non-classical effects such as modulation of protein-protein interactions, condensate formation and chemical degradation.

Comment[IDR Screen Name]	idr0097-reicher-proteintag/screenA	

Screen Sample Type	cell
							
Screen Description	We use CRISPR-Cas9 based intron tagging to generate cell pools expressing more than 900 GFP-fusion proteins (one GFP-tagged protein per cell). From that pool we isolated and imaged 720 clonal cell lines (one clonal cell line per well, 5 fields of view per well). Additionally, we sequenced the expressed intron-targeting sgRNA in each clone to identify the tagged protein in each clone. For 335 clonal cell lines our sgRNA amplicon sequencing strategy unambiguously identified the integrated sgRNAs indicating a single tagged protein, while in the remaining wells we could not unambiguisly identify the taged protein ('0' values in the respective columns in the library file). We then manually annotated the subcellular the subcellular protein localization of GFP-tagged protein to later compare them to antibody-based annotations available on The Human Protein Atlas.

Experiment Sample Type	cell
						
Experiment Description	We use CRISPR-Cas9 based intron tagging to generate cell pools expressing more than 900 GFP-fusion proteins (one GFP-tagged protein per cell). For this experiment, we seeded the cell pool in a single well of 384-well plate and imaged the entire well twice (0h and 3h timepoint, 289 fields of view per timepoint, raw tiff files were merged to 9 tiles per well). Cells in the same well were then fixed and we performed in situ sequencing to identify the expressed sgRNA in each cell indicating which protein is GFP tagged (7 cycles of in situ sequencing by synthesis, 289 fields of view per cycle,  raw tiff files were merged to 9 tiles per well).

Experiment Description	We use CRISPR-Cas9 based intron tagging to generate cell pools expressing more than 900 GFP-fusion proteins (one GFP-tagged protein per cell). For this experiment, we seeded the cell pool in a single well of 384-well plate and treated the cells with dBET6, a BRD4-targeting PROTAC. We imaged the entire well at three timepoints (before treatment, after 1h and 3h after treatment, 289 fields of view per timepoint). Cells in the same well were then fixed and we performed in situ sequencing to identify the expressed sgRNA in each cell indicating which protein is GFP tagged (8 cycles of in situ sequencing by synthesis, 289 fields of view per cycle).
